# Korean Keyboard

This keyboard allows you to type in English or Korean, without having to install a language to your computer.  This webapp also predicts whether you intend to add a letter to an individual character or start a new character.  In most cases, if it guesses incorrectly, it will correct the mistake by changing the previous character and starting a new one.
